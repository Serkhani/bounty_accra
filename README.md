# Chainlink Price Feed Game

## Overview

The Chainlink Price Feed Game is a two-player game built using React and the Chainlink Plugin for Web3.js. In this game, each player selects a set of 5 cryptocurrency price feeds. After a waiting period, the game fetches the initial and final prices for the selected feeds, and the player with the highest positive change in price wins!

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Players select 5 price feeds each from a list of available feeds.
- **Real-Time Price Fetching**: The game fetches live price data using Chainlink's decentralized oracles.
- **Visual Display of Prices**: The initial and final prices of each selected feed are displayed to both players.
- **Automatic Winner Determination**: The game calculates the total price change for each player and declares the winner.
