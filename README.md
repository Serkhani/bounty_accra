# Mainnet Price Feeds Selector

Welcome to the **Mainnet Price Feeds Selector** project! This React application allows two players to select different Chainlink price feeds and compare their values. The player who selects the feed with the higher value wins. 

## 🎯 **Project Idea**

The **Mainnet Price Feeds Selector** is a fun and interactive application that leverages Chainlink's price feeds to create a simple competition between two players. By selecting different price feeds, players can compare real-time prices of various assets and determine a winner based on which feed has a higher value.

## ✨ **Features**

- **Feed Selection**: Each player can choose from a list of available Chainlink price feeds.
- **Real-Time Comparison**: Fetch and compare the prices of the selected feeds.
- **Result Display**: Get instant feedback on which player has the higher price or if it's a draw.
